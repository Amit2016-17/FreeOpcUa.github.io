Python bindings can be found in the opcua-python repository. \r\n\r\nThe library is under development but works will all tested clients. It support addressspace browse, read, write and address space modification as well as subscriptions and datachange events.\r\n\r\nHistory is not yet supported\r\n\r\nAll expected OPC-UA objects are implemented in C++. Higher level Server, Client and Node objects are also available.\r\n\r\nExample high level Python server code:\r\n\r\n    s = opcua.Server()\r\n    s.load_cpp_addressspace(True)\r\n    s.set_endpoint(\"opc.tcp://192.168.56.1:4841\")\r\n    s.start()\r\n    try;\r\n        objects = s.get_objects_node()\r\n\r\n        m = objects.add_folder(\"2:MyFolder\")\r\n        v = m.add_variable(\"2:MyVariable\", 3)\r\n\r\n        count = 0\r\n        while True;\r\n            count += 1\r\n            v.set_value(count)\r\n        time.sleep(1);\r\n\r\n    finally:\r\n        s.stop()\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
